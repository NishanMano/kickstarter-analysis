Louise's Kickstarter Project Campaign Fundraiser

---

Introduction:

---

We used the data collected surrounding Kickstarter fundraisers around the world based on a variety of Categories. We narrowed down the data to find specific niches that Louise has specific interests in such as "plays" in "Great Britain."  We try to narrow down our data for related information that applies strictly to Louise. This removes most of the clutter in the large sum of data that we had surrounding Kickstarters. The main purpose behind this was to find the best month for Louise to launch her Kickstarter Fundraiser as well as how much should she budget for it. We narrowed our analysis to two possible outcomes which are "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" and "Outcomes based on Goals." We used data over a number of years and viewed how successful/unsuccessful a number of theater Kickstarters were over specific months over a span of a number of years. We also

Challenges:

To filter out data and remove outliers was a little difficult as we had to make advised decisions on removing specific data. We want to clear the data, and have it sorted properly; however, we do not want to remove data that look like outliers but really aren't. This just takes a bit more time and precision to review and ensure that the correct data is intact. It is also very easy for us to forget to clear previous filters which can easily throw off your data and create numerous errors. There have been multiple times when I would have to restart the project altogether, but it was a good learning experience as it shows the value in keeping your work clean and constantly saving your documents while making any major changes. It is also very easy to mislabel pivot chart fields and this in turn has graphs that look completely different than from what you initially expected.

Conclusion:

In our conclusion, we were able to determine that regarding "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" the month of May and June are optimal to launch as they produce the highest success rate in comparison to the highest unsuccessful rate for each respective month. We would also tell Louise to avoid launching any theater shows in the month of December as the number of outcomes between successful Kickstarter and failed Kickstarter is almost equal. My personal belief is that it is the time of New Year and people will have many resolutions that they would need to divert their funds towards aside from Kickstarter pledges. This data I believe is to be very indicative of how month-to-month trends are over the years and provide valuable insight for Louise to plan her schedule ahead. An optimal time for Louise to start off her fundraiser based on the data would be in the month of May and June. I believe June would be the safe option as it is slightly less for the number of fails in comparison to May. However, May does have a higher number of successful Kickstarts.

With regards to the data for "Outcomes based on Goals," we can provide Louise insight on how much she should project to save prior to starting a Kickstarter. Take an in-depth look at the chart below showing the statistics of our data. It is quite easy to see that Successful Kickstarters have very similar amounts of funds for Mean Goal and Mean Pledged, whereas when we look for the Mean Goal and Mean Pledged for Failed Kickstarters It is obvious that the leaders of these fundraisers were overestimating their pledges by close to $9000. We also notice that the median pledged was very low as well. This can lead us to believe that either the topic chosen was not popular among the masses or they canvased the fundraiser in the wrong location, or they simply asked the wrong donors altogether. Using the measures of spreads and comparing both the successful and failed columns can provide such a simplistic insight on how Louise should budget and plan.

Louise did mention that she has $4,000 to invest in her theater play taking place in Great Britain. In comparison to other funding goal ranges, we can see that this goal range is on average one of the better options. It's either she starts with this range or starts within the range. If Louise starts off her fundraiser around $1000 - $4999, her success rate would be high (~75%) based on past results. I believe this would be the best starting place as we can always invest more based on the results, we get with our initial investment of around $1000 - $4999.

More funding does not necessarily mean a higher success rate and we would want to communicate that to Louise. If we look at the next two ranges past $1000-$4999 which are $5000 - $9999 and $10 000 to $14 999. The results seen on the graph are not as promising as one would think. Approximately 55% of Kickstarter who had goals within this range were successful and 45% were unsuccessful.

We can also use the Box-Whisker Plot to provide further analysis for Louise. Looking at the graph below we can see that the "goal" box and whisker plot is closely aligned with the "pledged" box and whisker plot in the range from $0 - $1999. We can encourage Louise to spend her money wisely in the initial stages and to hold on to some of the $4000 if all of it is not needed immediately.

Reflecting:

---


I believe we could use different stacked bar graphs to show more data to Louise such as narrowing down more of the filters. One example could be is to look at specific plays in which Louise shows interest and compare their data. This can provide an even more accurate narrow analysis of a topic that will pique Louise's interest. The graphs provided do not provide the full picture as we could provide an even further breakdown by minimizing the range of each set of the x-axis for the "Outcomes Based on Goal." We could've focused the range of the entire "Amount of Goal" x-axis to ok around the range from "Less than $1000" to "$20000 to $25000."  Louise already told us she is budgeting for $4000. It is unnecessary info in my opinion, and we could've given her an even more accurate graph by removing the more expensive Kickstarter projects.
